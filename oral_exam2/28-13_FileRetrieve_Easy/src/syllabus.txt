Final Exam (Written): 12:30PM - 2:30PM 12/18/2020 Fri

Challenge Problem:  We will also have a "challenge" problem assigned on Dec 2-4.  Students are required to work on it in groups of 2-3 students per group between Dec 4-6.  This assignment counts for 5% of your final grade. Note, each student should be responsible for at least one feature for each submission.  You will also provide a concise description of the features implemented for your submission.  The 3 "best" submissions (determined by the TAs) will present and describe their submissions with an in-class presentation (approx 10 mins).  Minimum requirement is to run a live demo â€“ otherwise anything else is acceptable.  Students not presenting will rank each submission and presentation.  The top 3 presentations will be awarded additional extra credit bonuses of 30, 20, and 10% respectively.
